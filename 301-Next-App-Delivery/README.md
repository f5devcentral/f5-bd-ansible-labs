F5 SOLUTION SANDBOX SCENARIOS
===============================

Overview
--------

The F5 Solution Sandbox builds and configures a demo environment to get familiar with the solutions that F5 provides in security, performance, and visibility. Users can use this environment to try automation solutions, build demos and proof of concepts. Using the scenarios provided, users will be able to experience how F5 adds value and integrates into your build environment seamlessly.

The F5 Solution Sandbox delivers a few common scenarios to help you learn more:

•	Redirection of HTTP to HTTPS traffic to enforce secured connections
•	An automated SSL certificate update scenario to manage key updates
•	Web server pool membership management as a server maintenance scenario
•	A Web Application Firewall policy management demo which helps you understand how F5 uniquely helps protect you from scenarios such as SQL Injection and blacklisting bad BOTs

Best of all, these scenarios are all powered with simple Ansible scripts that require zero knowledge of F5 configuration.
